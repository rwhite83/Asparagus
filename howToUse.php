    <h1><strong>Tracking Items</strong></h1>
	
	<p>First choose a food you would like to track, something you are personally worried about or find yourself wasting too often.</p>

	<h1><strong>How to use</strong></h1>
	<p>It's as easy as could be!</p>
	<p>When you buy something, input it as bought!</p>
	<p>When you waste soemthing, input it as wasted!</p>
	<p>You're provided with an amount of this item that our algorithm determines is the safe amount of product you can buy without wasting anything!</p>
	<p>When you go to the store to buy more, only buy the amount suggested, and you should waste less and less over time, and as the result is perfected you should ultimately waste zero of that product at all!</p>
